              <p class="font-cabin text-rosewood text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">I started making candles in 1999 for myself because I was a huge candle lover but was always disappointed in the scent throw and burn quality that I got from store bought candles, even from the upper end candle companies. So in my quest for a better burning more fragrant candle, I started Candles By Victoria. I tested for over a year until I came up with the perfect wax formulation to give a full and complete burn all the way to the bottom of the candle. Then I tested and searched for the perfect scents for our line that would give off the strongest and most fragrant aromas!</p>
              <p class="font-cabin text-rosewood text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">I requested the help of my friends and family to give me honest opinions and through many months of testing and reformulating, Candles By Victoria went public in May of 2000 and has been going strong and growing ever since! In June of 2006 I opened my first retail store in Van, Texas where CBV currently resides. From my kitchen stove years ago to a small workshop in my backyard to the production facility, dreams do come true!</p>
              <p class="font-cabin text-rosewood text-lg leading-relaxed">Candles By Victoria is my dream and my passion, all of us here at CBV put our entire heart and soul into this business. Candles By Victoria is a family business started by me but loved and nurtured by my family. Our #1 priority is producing high quality, 100% handmade candles and wax melts that smell amazing! Top notch customer service is of utmost importance to us as well and we will go above and beyond the normal call of duty to make sure EVERY customer is satisfied with the products and the service they receive.</p>
